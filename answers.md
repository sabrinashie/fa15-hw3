1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
Create creates an object that is validated and saves to the database, while new creates an object, but does not validate or save it to the database.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
You can call instance_name.save to save it to the database.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
id

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
h = Cat.create(name:'hat')

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
Definitely HW2 was very confusing for me...but after working through it, I understand the MVC model much better.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
I liked that it took a lot less time than HW2! This is a pretty good HW in that I still felt like I learned a lot but it didn't take a super long time.
